Firebase doesnt provide sending otp on free tier, I tried it once earlier i tried using sha 1, 256 but wont work so my testing one is 8005331766 and 777777 these are creds for test and I have also recently used Brevo for email otp sending and verifying so I could have dont that but had to stick to firebase I have implemented everything to the pdf , Hope its all fine even if its not I will be very eger to learn and provide my contribution from day 1 in building of something big... Thank you :)
